    <h1>This Website</h1>

    <p>So I decided I needed a blog for the following reasons:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I've owned this domain for like a year now and not yet had a use for it,</li>
        <li>I have thoughts, and I can't keep them all to myself and</li>
        <li>maybe one day some employer might find it interesting!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, future employer, here it is in all its glory!</p>

    <p>
        Now, <a href="https://race2.org.uk">I have experience working with ReactJS</a>, and I am ashamed to say that I like it.
        But in the end of the day nothing beats pure HTML, and I don't even want to do web dev anyway so
        who gives a bollock?
    </p>

        The source code for this site is available in a <a href="https://github.com/sam007burke/samuelburke.co.uk">public github repo</a>,
        and it is derived from some coursework I completed in the second year of my CS degree.
