    <h1>Game Engine</h1>

    <p>
        Recently I have been exploring the world of C++ and OpenGL
        to get a flavour of 3D rendering and simulation. As a result,
        I have been spending far too much time working on what my peers
        have dubbed the "Croissant Simulator".
    </p>

    <p>
        Although I did not model this 3D croissant myself, I am nonetheless
        very proud of the fact that I can render it in my 3D world, and make
        it do things like spinning or move in a circle. Even just adding a
        red point light into the simulation to see how it illuminates the
        croissant brings me immense joy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working in C++, I have for the first time had to think about certain
        memory optimisations, such as pooling data into contiguous memory
        if I know that it will frequently be accessed together.
