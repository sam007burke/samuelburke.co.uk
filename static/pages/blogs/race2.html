    <h1>Race2 Tracker</h1>

    <p>
        St Andrews Charity Race 2 is a student-led fundraising activity
        in which teams of students race to some European city by
        hitchhiking all the way there.
    </p>

    <p>
        Racers send in their current location to the safety team, who would
        previously have to manually enter all information into an online form before the
        team's location gets publicly displayed on an interactive map.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Marcus and I joined the Race2 Committee, we were
        tasked with cleaning up and maintaining
        the web app. However, the source code was
        never handed over, so we had to start from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
        The new web app is written using a React frontend, its API runs on
        Node.js and Express.js. It includes a separate admin dashboard
        built using React Admin.
    </p>

    <p>
        The web app will be (or was) first used in March 2025, for the Race-2-Budapest.
